              <p>
                An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) is a
                cybersecurity tool designed to protect computer networks from
                unauthorized access and malicious activities. It monitors
                network traffic and system behavior to identify and respond to
                suspicious or potentially harmful events in real-time. IDPS can
                detect various threats, such as hacking attempts, malware
                infections, and data breaches, and can either alert
                administrators or take automated actions to block or mitigate
                these threats, enhancing the overall security posture of an
                organizations IT infrastructure.
